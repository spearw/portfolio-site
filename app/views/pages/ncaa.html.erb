                This project was developed as a collaborative effort to provide ease of evaluation of NCAA Fencing results. The NCAA calculations websites was built using Flask, a lightweight Python framework, as well as Bootstrap and vanilla JS for the front-end. The project scrapes data results from the official NCAA Fencing website, and calculates current rankings as well as shows future requirements for winning the tournament.

                Although this was a collaborative effort, my primary focus during this project was on the front end. The site features an adaptive color scheme based on the current leading school (note Ohio Stateâ€™s gray and scarlet on the screen shot above), easy navigation between all the events, and a mobile-friendly, responsive design.
